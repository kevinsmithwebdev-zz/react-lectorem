# Contributing

This is an open source project. Before trying to contribute, read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We are open to contributions, but still have a vision for how things should be.

If you find a bug, please raise and issue.

Think we would like to see improved:

- Convert to typescript.
- Convert to SASS.
- Convert the Player to a functional component - there are issues with packages using hooks.
- Improve testing.
- Add eslint - airbnb.
- Add functionality - hovering on a lect causes a tool tip with a translation pop up. The prop name will be "hover".
- Clicking on a lect will cause the player to play from there.
- Double clicking on a lect will cause that lect to loop.
