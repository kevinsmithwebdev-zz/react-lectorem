# Contributing

This is an open source project. Before trying to contribute, read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We are open to contributions, but still have a vision for how things should be.

If you find a bug, please raise an issue. If you have an idea, bring it up as an issue so you don't waste time adding something that we won't want.

We don't have a style guide yet, but please try to mimic what you see.

Things we would like to see improved:

- Double-Clicking on a lect will cause the player to play from there.
- Allow css info to be passed in as optional props. Basically, allowing the consuming app to pass in their own parameters.
- Allow different sizes of texts, improve spacing.
- If no sentenceTranslation is provided, allow (perhaps with a flag) joining the individual lect translations.

## Steps to contribute.

1. Find an existing issue and claim it ... or create an issue, get it approved, and claim it.
2. Fork the repo.
3. Create an appropriately named branch.
4. Make your changes.
5. Test your changes.
6. Run `npm run validate` to confirm you haven't broken anything.
7. Add and commit your changes.
8. Make your pull request - reference the relevant issue number in the PR with a preceding "#", like "Issue: #12".
