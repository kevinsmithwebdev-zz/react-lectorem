# Contributing

This is an open source project. Before trying to contribute, read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We are open to contributions, but still have a vision for how things should be.

If you find a bug, please raise and issue. If you have an idea, bring it up as an issue so you don't waste time.

I don't have a style guide yet, but please try to mimic what you see.

Think we would like to see improved:

- Convert to typescript.
- Convert to SASS.
- Convert the Player to a functional component - there are issues with packages using hooks.
- Improve testing.
- Double-Clicking on a lect will cause the player to play from there.
- Allow css info to be passed in as optional props.
- Allow different sizes of texts, improve spacing.
